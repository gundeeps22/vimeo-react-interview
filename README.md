## Available Scripts (taken from React.js generated README.md)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Installing a Dependency

The generated project includes React and ReactDOM as dependencies. It also includes a set of scripts used by Create React App as a development dependency. You may install other dependencies (for example, React Router) with `npm`:

```sh
npm install --save react-router
```

Alternatively you may use `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add react-router
```
### `Dependencies for this Application`

Note that this application uses react bootstrap library, meaning that the following commands must be run in order to install all the dependencies:

```sh
npm install --save react react-dom 
npm install --save react-bootstrap
```

This works for any library, not just `react-router`.
